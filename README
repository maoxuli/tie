Tie: Share moods, share today!

Today is everyday!
This is a class project I did at The George Washington University
in fall 2010 when I was a master student in Computer Science. 

The typical architecutre of social networking applications are 
discussed and a prototype system is developed as a proof of 
concept. A client software running on Android system works as a 
user interface to capture user's current information, such as 
current mood, then pushed to central service system, where users'
personal infomation is managed with a database. The service 
system analyzes users' data in a long term basis and feeds some 
statistical informations to users, such as moods changing mode 
of users. Users share their personal information on a friens-
based realationship. The client software communicates with 
service system in a REST-style or similar fashion. The central 
service system is developed on a PHP MVC framework and the 
popular LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) platform. This project 
gives us insight into the principle of social networks and the 
fundamental knowledge about the APIs of Android system.
